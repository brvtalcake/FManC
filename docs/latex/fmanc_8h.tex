\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is the main header of the lib, where all of the headers are included. 

If you don\textquotesingle{}t want to have troubles, just include this one instead of including the others one by one. If you want to use the functions defined in \mbox{\hyperlink{fcmx_8h}{this}} or \mbox{\hyperlink{lex__yy_8h}{this}} source files, then write something like 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#define USE\_FCMX TRUE}}

\end{DoxyCode}
 (actually, just define USE\+\_\+\+FCMX with a certain value, no matter what it is).

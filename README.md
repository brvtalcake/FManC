# libfmanc
File manager in C
## IMPORTANT NOTE
There is still a lot to do to make this lib usable. Moreover, keep in mind that I'm just writing this lib to make easier the development of an extension of C, including :
- structs mutators (kind of "methods")
- new types : dictionnaries, lists, trees, graphs, vectors.

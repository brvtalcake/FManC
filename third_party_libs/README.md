# Usage of the third party libraries

- metalang99 : used to metaprogram custom statements and things like that.
- [nobuild](https://github.com/tsoding/nobuild) : I tried to build my own build system with it, but I finally prefered the standard Makefile way. I mention it even though it's not even still in the repository. Maybe I'll use it again in the future, but for now it's not used too.

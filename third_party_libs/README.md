# Usage of the third party libraries

- metalang99 : this one was initally included in the first repository layout (e.g. the first release) to metaprogram one of the test suite I did. Maybe I'll use it again in the future, but for now it's not used.
- [nobuild](https://github.com/tsoding/nobuild) : I tried to build my own build system with it, but I finally prefered the standard Makefile way. I mention it even though it's not even still in the repository. Maybe I'll use it again in the future, but for now it's not used too.
